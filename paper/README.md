The directory contains the Vasp input data (POSCAR,INCAR,KPOINTS), Vasp output data (OUTCAR/PROCAR) and band structures generated for an academic paper (to be published). Also included is information about the Vasp POTCARs used, generated using [vasppy](https://github.com/bjmorgan/vasppy/blob/master/vasppy/scripts/potcar_spec.py).
It also contains a Jupyter notebook outlining the key calculation steps used in the paper.
A rendered version of the notebook can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lucydot/effmass/blob/master/paper/notebook.ipynb).
